# Mozart-Oz v2

The Mozart Programming System is an open source implementation of Oz 3.
This repository contains the upcoming version 2 of the system.
The [Website](http://www.mozart-oz.org/) currently refers to the last stable
version, which is 1.4.0.

This is a meta-repository that aggregates all the repositories of Mozart as
submodules:

* [Virtual Machine](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2-vm)
* [Bootcompiler](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2-bootcompiler)
* [Standard library](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2-library)
* [Compiler](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2-compiler)

The purpose of this meta-repository is to link together commits of these
subprojects that are globally coherent. Later it will also provide a unified,
automated build process.
